Description


This pre-work study guide was created to explain the basics of coding using javascript, css, and other coding vices such as vs code, and git bash. I was motivated to build this project so I would always have a reference to look back on throughout my coding journey. I solved many problems through out this project by creating a structure for my website.
Table of Contents (Optional)
